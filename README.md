# Blog

This is a repository for my [personal blog](https://blog.wooseop.kim) which:

- is fast and simple, as all websites should be.
- uses [`thumbhash`](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash), a better alternative to `blurhash`, for placeholders.
- is written in [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro).
- has an RSS feed.
- uses ["cookieless"](https://posthog.com/tutorials/cookieless-tracking) [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) for analytics.
